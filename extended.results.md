### Relative ICU admits--after distribution to healthcare facilities
#### Colors show the relative number of ICU admits in each county after cases have been distributed to healthcare systems. Counties with 0 ICU beds, and thus no capacity to treat critical cases, are shaded grey. All cases from regions with 0 ICU beds have been allocated to other counties (see methodological notes below).

### Relative Hospitalizations--after distribution to healthcare facilities
#### Colors show the relative number of ICU admits in each county after cases have been distributed to healthcare systems. Counties with 0 ICU beds, and thus no capacity to treat severe cases, are shaded grey. All cases from regions with 0 hospital beds beds have been allocated to other counties (see methodological notes below).
